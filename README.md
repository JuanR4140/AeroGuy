# AeroGuy
AreoGuy is a Nintendo DS game made with libnds and NightFox Lib to demonstrate and to hopefully show others the ways of making a DS game as most documentation available online is vague. Hopefully this helps and you like the game too ^^

# How-To
If you're a weird person and you'd like to code for a 15 year old console rather than using a modern thing like Unity or Unreal Engine, then you'd come to the.. right.. wrong... place? I'll add how to do stuff here the more I learn about NFLib and libnds. I'm by no means an expert, so don't expect the top quality code here.

# Installing
Head over to https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases and install devkitpro on the root of your machine (C: in Windows) 
Now go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/nflib/ and install Night Fox Lib inside the devkitpro folder.

Look up how to set those folders in your path and includePath for your C compiler.

I'm a bad explainer sorry


# Setting Up
Go to one of the examples in the nflib examples folder and copy the make file into a new folder somewhere in your computer. Make a "source" folder, "nitrofiles" folder, and copy the nflib folder in nflib folder into the root of your project folder (Probably add that folder to the includePath too). Now that you're set up, It's time to get some code done!
